The printf project is a collaboration between Brian Sechelo and Pauline Maina both of who are students at the ALX Software Engineering program. 
The function "_printf" imitates the actual "printf" command that is usually located in the C stdio.h library. It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the manual 3 of "printf".
The prototype of the _printf function is as follows
int _printf(const char *format, ...)
_printf is a variadic function which means it can receive infinite number of arguments as depicted in its prototype
The program returns the number of chars printed
